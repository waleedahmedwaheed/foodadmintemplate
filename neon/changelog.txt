	=== NOTE TO BUYERS ===

	As you see we are continuously updating Neon with new features,
	updates, compatibility issues with other plugins and other things 
	even that it has been time that we created this Admin Theme.
	
	When any client rate us with low stars we think that it will not
	contribute so much on our product improvement.
	
	We kindly ask you if you can increase your rating on our theme. 
	If not, at least tell us what we need to improve to make our product
	more sophisticated to meet your needs.
	
	Hope that you will reconsider your rating :)
	
	
	=== ACCESS TO GIT FILES ===
	
	If you want access to private repository of Neon Git files you must
	contact us in our forum (ThemeForest) and ask for invite in BitBucket.org
	
	There is a limited number of invites (only 5) but we are going to remove
	the old invites to make new place for new invites.
